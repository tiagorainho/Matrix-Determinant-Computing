# Matrix-Determinant-Computing
Project for CLE to provide high performing determinant computation

## How to run
In ``threads`` and ``threads_processes`` there is a scripts folder where it contains a ``build.sh`` and ``run.sh``. Use those scripts to experiment with the project.

The ``gpu`` contains a ``Makefile``. Note: the gpu version requires a Nvidia, if there is none in your computer, I recommend to ssh to one that does and run there.
